<h1><b>O-RAN</b></h1>

In an Open RAN environment, the RAN is disaggregated into three main building blocks:
<ul>
  <li>the Radio Unit (RU)
</li>
  <li>the Distributed Unit (DU)
</li>
  <li>the Centralised Unit (CU)
</li>
</ul>

The RU is where the radio frequency signals are transmitted, received, amplified, and digitized. The RU is located near or integrated into, the antenna. The DU and CU are the computation parts of the base station, sending the digitalized radio signal into the network. The DU is physically located at or near the RU whereas the CU can be located nearer the Core.

The key concept of Open RAN is “opening” the protocols and interfaces between these various building blocks (radios, hardware, and software) in the RAN. The O-RAN ALLIANCE has defined different interfaces within the RAN including those for:

OpenRANGE vCU key benefits:

<ul>
  <li>Enables interworking with MEC applications through Radio Network Information Service (RNIS) API
</li>
  <li>Segregated user plane/control plane support (over E1AP) maximizes cost efficiency (resource pooling)
</li>
  <li>High-availability support
</li>
</ul>


OpenRANGE vDU key benefits:

<ul>
  <li>SDN based L2 transport capabilities enables support for transport network slicing

</li>
  <li>Sliceable L2 architecture enables support for RAN network slicing

</li>
  <li>L1/L2 aggregation enabling inter RU carrier aggregation and multipoint transmission schemes

</li>
</ul>
