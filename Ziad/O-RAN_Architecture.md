<h1><b>O-RAN</b></h1>

In an Open RAN environment, the RAN is disaggregated into three main building blocks:
<ul>
  <li>the Radio Unit (RU)
</li>
  <li>the Distributed Unit (DU)
</li>
  <li>the Centralised Unit (CU)
</li>
</ul>

The RU is where the radio frequency signals are transmitted, received, amplified, and digitized. The RU is located near or integrated into, the antenna. The DU and CU are the computation parts of the base station, sending the digitalized radio signal into the network. The DU is physically located at or near the RU whereas the CU can be located nearer the Core.

The key concept of Open RAN is “opening” the protocols and interfaces between these various building blocks (radios, hardware, and software) in the RAN. The O-RAN ALLIANCE has defined different interfaces within the RAN including those for:
