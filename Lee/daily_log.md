- [x] Had a lunch meeting with Joe and Sean to discuss about the internship plan  

Questions for later:  
Before ask Yongho to figure out this task: instrumentation interface and the integration of new instruments into existing experimental workflows. Both teams will work to establish an open source collaborative network.

#### Friday June 3th ####
- [x] Attended the PAISE Workshop: www.paise.org
- [x] Read the file *RPL software/network brainstorm* and *WORKFLOWs for Modular SAL Demo* shared by Joe

#### Monday June 6th ####
- [x] Had a meeting with Pete and Raj to discuss about the overall summer plan (Yongho and Rory virtually)
- [x] Met Doga, Casey and Rafael in the robot room and talked about the schedule.  

-Things to do:  
Reading up the documents shared by Doga by this Friday  
Preparing tomorrow meeting with Joe & Francisco to catch up the WAGGLE OS process

#### Tuesday June 7th ####

- [x] Finished up the ROS course week 1, and took an exam for the certificate
- [x] Emailed HR to figure out Alien Determination Form (ANL67)

Things to do:
Research into the ROS system and how to apply it  

#### Wednesday June 8th ####

- [x] Attended the SAGE software team meeting (brief demo of accomplishments over the past sprint)
- [x] Set up RPI finally
- [x] Updated my payment check on Argonne Workday
- [x] Obtained the Argonne prox card

Things to do:  
Reading up following documents: https://docs.waggle-edge.ai/docs/about/overview and https://github.com/waggle-sensor/  
Preparing tomorrow meeting with Joe & Neal - Interface for new nano-student nodes to register with beekeeper to get credentials to a “student” beehive

#### Thursday June 9th ####

- [x] Had a meeting with Joe and Francisco to discuss about the WAGGLE OS/WES
- [x] Set up Jetson Nano and install/test ros docker file on Nano, ref: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/tutorials/jetson-container

Things to do:  
Reading up the Lightweight Kubernetes, ref: https://k3s.io

#### Friday June 10th ####

- [x] Had a discussion with Yomi; Self-Supervised Learning Tree Detection
- [x] Tested ros/ros2 files on Nano

Things to do:  
I need to implement the nano image to deploy, run codes from ECR, and get the ros example from Yongho working to control something in the robot space. Furthermore, as the previous ros file built by Yongho might need a different ROS version (LIDAR), it needs to be modified  

----------------------------------------------
### Week 2: 6/13 to 6/17 ###
#### Monday June 13th ####
- [x] Attended the Argonne Fifth Quantum Computing Tutorial Day 1: https://events.cels.anl.gov/event/267/timetable/#20220613.detailed and https://github.com/yurialexeev/Argonne-Quantum-Computing-Tutorial-2022
- [x] Had a meeting with Yomi to discuss about the ECR and docker for the Sage project.
- [x] Finally completed read up https://github.com/waggle-sensor/ and https://docs.waggle-edge.ai/docs/about/overview

Reading up and implemented Docker tutorial: https://www.katacoda.com/courses/container-runtimes

#### Tuesday June 14th ####

- [x] Attended the Argonne Fifth Quantum Computing Tutorial Day2
- [x] Had a meeting with Joe, Francisco, and Sammi. Francisco and I figured out the outline for setting up Nano on Ansible. The steps are following:  

```sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack```
'''Sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit'''
'''sudo apt show nvidia-jetpack'''
'''Cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt'''
Current Jetson NAno version: JetPack 4.6 that includes 10.2 CUDA

#### Wednesday June 15th ####

- [x] Attended the Argonne Fifth Quantum Computing Tutorial Day3
