# Welcome to my README! 
My hope is to make this a useful resource (mostly for me to reference) of the things I've learned so far! A loootta Telit manual stuff so far :)
## Telit FN980m Information
This is the module we are using to eventually connect our Waggle Nodes to the 5G network. They kind of act like cell phones -they can send and recieve calls and SMS- and we will mainly use them like a phone putting up a hotspot. It's a pretty versatile little machine!
### Helpful AT Commands
This section will not tell you the full functionality of the commands, but instead serves as a culled down list of relevant commands. Use this in conjunction with the Telit AT Command manual (not sure if it's kosher to link that here)
