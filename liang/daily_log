  - Met Raj in person
  - Set up my workstation
  
June 14th
  - Finished setting up ssh key and github
  - Began reading papers suggested by Nicola
  - Began looking into pix2pix GAN model
  
June 15th
  - Read research papers on differences in wildfire smoke plumes
  - Familiarized myself with fundamentals in neural nets
  - set up docker with vscode

June 16th
  - Followed tutorials on pix2pix
  - set up training images from kaggle
  - emailed Nicola about using colab/jupyter or cloud service for building models

June 17th
  - experimented with pix2pix pre-generated models
  - used python package dataset-tools for generating canny edges from images

June 20th
  - Researched more into GANs model
