## Andre's Daily Logs ##

**June 13th**
* [x] Attend 9:00AM virtual orientation for Argonne
* [x] Look into Waggle and the network of Sage nodes, edge computing, cloud uploading, cloud computing, and cloud extracting
* [x] Finish paperwork for onboarding
* [x] Request access to waggle-sensor GitHub
* [x] Join slack for waggle-sensor team
* [x] Setup Argonne accounts: email, employee account, etc


**June 14th**
* [x] Zoom call with Dr. Raj, who filled me up with the projects our team is working
* [x] Accept invitation for waggle-sensor GitHub
* [x] Look into ways to create a private local network between NVIDIA system, RAK2287, and the individual sensors using LoRaWAN
    - Looked into LoRaWAN networks and how it can be setup as a local network using the MAC addresses
    - Found useful read https://www.cardinalpeak.com/blog/setting-up-a-lora-gateway-to-view-iot-device-data : uses Rak7243, which also has antennas for LoRa and GPS system
        - Flash SD card (check out above link for more details on this), attach antennas, test WiFi connectivity

        - **instead of connecting to The Things Network (TTN, a LoRaWAN server), we can connect to the NVIDIA system**

**June 14th**
* [x] Sort out transportation to Argonne Laboratory
* [x] Once transportation is sort out, register for badge appointment with Argonne Lab
* [ ] TMS
* [x] Lined up with Pritchard on our current tasks
* [x] Look into network authentication and certificates
* [x] Look into Arduino LoRaWAN
* [x] Figure out RAK2287 and Wisgate network logistics, useful for tomorrow:
    - RAK commercial LoRaWAN (need to have a built in server): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YES3DD-N60&ab_channel=RAKwireless
    - RAK2287 manual setup:

* [x] Refamiliarize with new GitHub instructions

**June 15th**
* [x] Acquire gatepass and badge
* [x] Work env set up
* [x] Familiarize with linux terminal
* [x] Update NVIDIA nano system
* [x] Test out connections:
    - RAK pi to personal computer
    - RAK pi to NVIDIA nano
    - NVIDIA nano to Argonne-auth
* [x] Further studies on establishing LoRaWAN with RAK pi and the sensor nodes
